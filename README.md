# **Heimdallr**

> \***\*Multipurpose, Functional, Ever watching\*\***

> _Notice_: This repo is a complete rewrite of Heimdallr built upon [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/) and [wokcommands](https://www.npmjs.com/package/wokcommands).Some fuctionality may not currently be in the recent build or may be dropped entirely. All commands will now use Slash Commands.

Heimdallr is an all in one Discord bot built with server functionality in mind. From easy fun to server administration Heimdallr aims to be the only bot you need. Enjoy the plethora of commands at your disposal whilst it guards the realms.

**Why Heimdallr:**

- Server Management and configurable logging.
- Provide additonal and fun features to your members.
- Enguage your community in new exciting ways.
- Peace of mind the frost giants are being held in check.

## Features

**TBA**

## Guild Setup

Currently none, additional details provided later.

## Self-hosting

We highly encourage you to invite this bot over self-hosting. Self-hosting aka running the bot provided within this repo on your own is permitted but not supported. Source code is provided in the interest of being open with our community. Ultimately no help or guidance will be provided for setup, editing, or any actions from running the bot within your own self-hosted enviroment. You are more then welcome to join the support server but understand any issues or questions stemming from self-hosting may be ignored or disregarded entirely. If you still wish to continue to self host the bot you will need at the very least the following:

- MongoDB
- Node 16.17.0
- Creation of .env file, examples of what is required are listed within the docker-compose example file.
- API keys are used for some commands/services.
- Minor editing may be required to fulfill your environment.

If hosted with docker you will need an understanding of docker and the ability to edit a docker-compose file as required.

> _Notice_: Repeated requests for aid with self-hosting will lead to a ban from the support server.
